# Nautilus Project – Day 5 Task

## Overview
Following a security audit, the **xFusionCorp Industries** security team has decided to strengthen application and server security using **SELinux**.  
As part of the initial rollout, the following requirements have been established for **App Server 3** in the **Stratos Datacenter**:

1. Install the required SELinux packages.  
2. Permanently **disable SELinux** for now (it will be re-enabled after configuration changes).  
3. No need to reboot the server immediately (a maintenance reboot is scheduled).  
4. Ignore the current runtime SELinux status — the important part is that SELinux will remain **disabled after reboot**.

## Infrastructure Details

| Server Name | IP             | Hostname                          | User   | Password | Purpose        |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| stapp03     | 172.16.238.12  | stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com   | banner | BigGr33n | Nautilus App 3 |

---

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Connect to App Server 3
SSH into the server from the jump host:
```bash
ssh banner@stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
````

Password:

```
BigGr33n
```

---

### 2. Install SELinux Packages

Ensure SELinux and its required tools are installed:

```bash
sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted policycoreutils
```

> If using a Debian/Ubuntu-based system:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y selinux selinux-utils policycoreutils
```

---

### 3. Permanently Disable SELinux

Edit the SELinux configuration file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
```

Find the line:

```
SELINUX=enforcing
```

Change it to:

```
SELINUX=disabled
```

Save and exit.

---

### 4. Verify Configuration File

Check the file to ensure SELinux is disabled:

```bash
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config
```

Expected output:

```
SELINUX=disabled
```

---

## Notes

* **Do not reboot now** – a scheduled reboot will apply the changes tonight.
* After the reboot, SELinux will be **permanently disabled**.
* Current runtime status (from `getenforce` or `sestatus`) may still show `Enforcing` or `Permissive` until the reboot occurs.

---

## Verification Checklist

✅ SELinux packages are installed on **stapp03**

✅ `/etc/selinux/config` is updated with `SELINUX=disabled`

✅ No reboot was performed (scheduled reboot will enforce the change)

✅ After reboot, SELinux will remain disabled permanently
